        <p style="font-size:30px">
                A towering white building at the interface of diagonal and overturning lanes. Guling Pavilion 
                is known as the second safest place in the world after Hogwarts, so wizards are willing to deposit 
                their gold and silver treasures in Guling Pavilion. Guling Pavilion is run by a group of goblins, 
                and these goblins stipulate that they can only get to the Treasury by a mining car that rotates to 
                the underground, and only the goblins can open the Treasury and take out their deposits. They always 
                have their own ways to prevent intruders, and they have their own rules that bind each other to prevent 
                their peers from revealing bank secrets.

        <p style="font-size:30px">Although the wizard had only these clothes, Mrs. Morkin's gown seemed to be the best. 
            Because this is where most Hogwarts students buy gowns. Mrs. Morkin is a friendly, stout witch. Mrs. Morkin's
             gown store is next to Lichen Bookstore. It not only sells Hogwarts student gowns, but also long gowns such 
             as sequins, ironing-free gowns, decorative gowns, self-cultivation, relaxation, lengthening and constant 
             temperature gowns. Mrs. Morkin will also specialize in large gowns for large witches and witches. Recent 
             advertisements show that the gowns sold in Mrs. Morkin's gowns store are self-ironed and repaired.

    <div class="text-success">
        <h3 style="font-size:50px">Flourish and Blotts:</h3>
        <p style="font-size:30px">This is a large wizard Bookstore full of bookcases that go directly to the ceiling. 
            Lichen Bookstore sells elementary wizard books, but it is probably the only bookstore that provides Hogwarts 
            students with learning textbooks, even though Hogwarts courses require books beyond what they sell.
                    Lichen Bookstore holds temporary signing parties and accepts book orders by letter. They express books 
                    by owl. They also accept advance bookings for large orders with huge demand.
                    In addition to the owner of the bookstore, Lichen Bookstore employs Deputy storekeeper and sometimes
                     assistant stores at the monthly salary of 42 Kim Gallon. Bookstores don't work as easily as they think. 
                     It's obvious that they're used to dealing with weird and troublesome books, such as biting books, invisible books, 
                     and the signing party of Gideiro Lohatt, where crowds are almost uncontrollable. So the job advertisement posted by 
                     Lichen Bookstore asks the wizard or witch to be good at stabilizing the situation.
